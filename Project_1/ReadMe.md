# A ladder snake-like game

# A user selects a random number between 1 and 6

#Confirm if the random number selected is what you want, if no, you can select another number:

# There are magic numbers that if selected numbers cummulative add to, the user gets a leap to a higher number, conversely,
# if these numbers add to certain numbers as well, the user is drawn back (slumps to a lower number)

#   magic numbers (ladder) = 3 ( takes you to ---> 15), 39 (takes you to ---> 65), 31 (takes you to --->70), 28 (takes you to --->5)
#            40 (takes you to ---> 85)
#  unlucky umbers (snake bite) = 99 (slumps to--->79), 35 (slumps to---> 20), 72 (slumps to--->10)

# the board consists of numbers ranging  from 1 to 100.
# If a number cummulatively exceeds 100, a user has three chances three chances to select a number between 
# the random numbers (1 to 6 ) to win, otherwise, the user loses.
